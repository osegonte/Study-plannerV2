# PDF Study Planner

A React-based application for tracking reading time and managing study sessions with PDF documents.

## Project Stages

- [x] **Stage 1**: PDF Viewer Core ‚úÖ
- [x] **Stage 2**: Reading Time Tracking ‚úÖ  
- [x] **Stage 3**: Estimated Reading Time ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Stage 4**: Topic Organization  
- [ ] **Stage 5**: Dashboard & Analytics

## Stage 3 Features ‚úÖ

### üìà Reading Speed Analysis
- **Personal Reading Speed**: Calculate pages per hour based on your actual reading
- **Average vs Median**: Smart calculation using median for better accuracy with outliers
- **Confidence Levels**: Low/Medium/High/Very High confidence based on data quality
- **Adaptive Estimates**: More accurate predictions as you read more pages

### ‚è∞ Completion Estimates
- **Total Document Time**: Estimate how long the entire PDF will take
- **Remaining Time**: Time needed to finish from current page
- **Finish By Time**: Predicted completion time (e.g., "Finish by 3:45 PM")
- **Progress Visualization**: Visual progress bar with percentage complete

### üéØ Smart Predictions
- **Data-Driven**: Uses your actual reading patterns, not generic estimates
- **Outlier Detection**: Handles unusually fast/slow pages intelligently
- **Confidence Scoring**: Tells you how reliable the estimates are
- **Real-Time Updates**: Estimates improve as you read more pages

### üìä Advanced Analytics
- **Reading Speed Indicator**: Live speed display in toolbar
- **Fastest/Slowest Pages**: Identify which pages took longest/shortest time
- **Data Coverage**: Shows how much of the document contributes to estimates
- **Detailed Breakdowns**: Multiple time formats for different contexts
